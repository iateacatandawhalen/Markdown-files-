The Wrathborne Roots are an ancient and powerful network of emotional conduits that connect the hosts of wrathforms to a primal, unseen force. This energy is the very essence of intense human emotions—wrath, sorrow, trauma, and despair—transformed into living energy that manifests as the wrathforms. These roots act as both a literal and metaphorical pathway through which emotional pressure and unresolved trauma travel, giving rise to the wrathforms that we now know.

## Origin of the Wrathborne Roots

The Wrathborne Roots were first awakened when Jesus Christ, the first known wrathform host, breathed his final breath. His emotional turmoil and suffering were so profound that they acted as a catalyst for the creation of the Wrathborne, a set of primal energies that could be accessed by any human host suffering on the same scale. This created a bond between humanity and the Wrathborne entities, making it possible for individuals in extreme emotional states to give birth to the wrathforms we know today.

The Sinai Mountain in Israel is believed to be the primal site where the Wrathborne Roots first sprouted. The place where Jesus' emotional energy reached its peak became the nexus, where the root system originated and connected to the emotional energy of humanity. Over time, this root network spread across the globe, with various continents and cultures each forming their own distinct branches of the Wrathborne Roots. These branches align with the emotional struggles and sociopolitical issues faced by specific regions, meaning the wrathforms they produce often reflect the unique emotional pressures and traumas of their people.

## The Nature of the Wrathborne Roots

The Wrathborne Roots are not merely metaphorical or symbolic; they are real, living entities that span the world. These roots are capable of connecting the suffering of individuals to the collective emotional energy that has been stored and nurtured in the roots. The roots serve as conduits, channels of energy through which the wrathforms are birthed and which continue to nourish them once they manifest.

The roots themselves can be thought of as a vast web of connections that extend both across time and space. Each individual's pain and emotional struggle feeds into the system, creating new nodes of power. Some branches are so large and powerful that they can influence entire nations, while others remain small, linked to specific individuals or smaller groups.

## The Influence of Governments

Over the centuries, governments and political entities have attempted to control or manipulate the Wrathborne Roots for their own purposes. The roots themselves are incredibly difficult to control, and attempts to harness their power for personal or political gain have often led to disastrous results. However, the Chinese government stands as the only known political entity to have successfully controlled a branch of the Wrathborne Roots, using it to monitor and regulate emotional unrest within its borders.

By tapping into these emotional conduits, the government is able to influence the development and control of wrathforms, but at great cost. This control is seen by many as an unnatural interference with the natural flow of human emotion, often suppressing the raw power of these entities to maintain societal order.

## Wrathborne Roots by Continent

The Wrathborne Roots manifest differently depending on the continent, due to the unique emotional struggles and societal conditions that arise in each part of the world. These regions are linked by different emotional histories and collective traumas, which influence the types of wrathforms that are born from them.

- **Europe**: In Europe, the Wrathborne Roots are often tied to historical events like war, oppression, and revolution. The emotional weight of centuries of conflict has caused many powerful wrathforms to emerge, particularly those related to national identity and resistance.

- **North America**: North America's Wrathborne Roots are deeply connected to issues of social justice, inequality, and environmental destruction. The struggles of marginalized communities have given rise to wrathforms that embody both the anger of resistance and the sorrow of displacement.

- **Asia**: In Asia, the Wrathborne Roots reflect both ancient cultural traditions and modern-day political strife. The emotional burden of economic pressure, familial expectations, and political control has created wrathforms that balance both aggression and preservation.

- **Africa**: Africa's Wrathborne Roots are deeply connected to themes of colonialism, slavery, and the fight for freedom. The wrathforms here often reflect the power of resilience, with many born from the collective trauma of past injustices.

- **South America**: In South America, the Wrathborne Roots are intertwined with struggles for land, independence, and survival. The wrathforms born from this region often have ties to nature, reflecting the connection between human suffering and the natural world.

## The Future of the Wrathborne Roots

As the emotional struggles of humanity continue to evolve, so too do the Wrathborne Roots. With the rise of new global crises—climate change, political unrest, and societal fractures—the roots may grow more powerful, potentially giving rise to even more wrathforms. While some view the Wrathborne Roots as a source of strength and resistance, others fear their influence will only serve to fuel further conflict and suffering.

One thing remains certain: the Wrathborne Roots will continue to shape the course of human history, as long as there are individuals who feel the weight of their emotions so profoundly that they give birth to the wrathforms. Whether they are a force for good or ill, the roots are forever entwined with the fates of those who summon them.

## Conclusion

The Wrathborne Roots are more than just the origin of wrathforms; they are a reminder of the deep, untapped emotional power within humanity. These roots connect every person who has ever experienced great emotional turmoil, and through them, the wrathforms are born. Whether this power leads to salvation or destruction is a question that remains unanswered, as the Wrathborne Roots continue to grow and change with the tides of human emotion.
