# The Sight of the Roots

The true nature of the **Wrathborne Roots**—its branching paths, pulsing etheric data, and ancient intent—remains hidden to most.

Only two kinds of people can perceive the Wrathborne Roots in their full, unfiltered form:

- Those who are **queer**, in any form or expression.
- Those who are deeply **entuned with the world**, bound by empathy, awareness, and resistance to systemic oppression.

To all others, the Roots appear only as vague shadows, whispers of something greater. But to the attuned, the Roots are alive—a network of defiance, memory, and hope humming beneath the surface of reality.

Their perception of the Roots often manifests visually like glowing tendrils of light or streams of fire-like data flowing through space, usually most visible during emotionally charged moments.

In those moments, one doesn’t just *see* the Roots—they feel them, like an old signal humming through the bones of the world.

## Cloaked Calm

An additional phenomenon observed by many wrathform hosts is the **cloaking effect** experienced by calm-state wrathforms.

Individuals who harbor **transphobic views**, or who possess mental/emotional alignments that would normally **trigger wrathform transformations**, are fundamentally **unable to perceive** wrathforms in their calm form.

To them, these creatures appear as nothing more than ordinary animals: a bird, a fox, a deer—mundane and forgettable.

This visual masking is not a conscious defense but a **natural magical reflex of the Roots**, protecting wrathforms and their hosts from premature escalation and misidentification. Only when wrathforms enter heightened emotional states—or wrathform is deliberately revealed—does their true nature become undeniable, even to the unaware.

However, with **enough time and training**, a wrathform host can **ask their companion/wrathform to show themselves**, to **unmask** in front of a select group of people who are supportive of their host’s identity. This process is deeply emotional and symbolic, as the act of unmasking represents a declaration of trust and solidarity.

In these moments, the calm-state wrathforms appear to those around them in their true form—bright, ethereal, and unmistakable. This mutual sharing of power reinforces the bond between the wrathform and their host, strengthening their connection to the Roots and each other.
