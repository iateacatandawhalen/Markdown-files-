# Sight of the Wrathborne Roots

The Wrathborne Roots are not visible to everyone, as their true nature is hidden beneath layers of perception. Only certain individuals are able to see or feel the roots and their energy. This rare ability is mostly reserved for those who have an intrinsic connection to the world or are deeply attuned to their own emotional and spiritual experiences. 

## Who Can See or Feel the Roots

The following groups of individuals can typically feel or perceive the Wrathborne Roots:

1. **Queer Individuals**: The most common group able to feel the Wrathborne Roots are those who identify as queer. This includes, but is not limited to, trans, nonbinary, gender non-conforming, and other LGBTQIA+ individuals. Their connection to the roots is inherently linked to their marginalized status and the unique emotional experiences they navigate throughout their lives.

2. **Individuals Attuned to the World**: Those who are deeply connected to nature, spirituality, or the mystical aspects of life may also have access to the Wrathborne Roots. This can include shamans, spiritual leaders, and other individuals who possess heightened sensitivity to the world around them.

3. **Activists**: Individuals who engage in activism and seek to dismantle systems of oppression are often able to feel the roots, as they are in tune with the collective struggle for justice and equality.

## Exceptions to Who Can Feel the Roots

Typically, people who hold deeply negative views or opinions about trans individuals, such as transphobes, are unable to feel the Wrathborne Roots. These individuals are shut off from the mystical forces that power the roots, as their energies are in direct opposition to the spirit of inclusion, love, and understanding.

However, in rare cases, some rather stupid and eager individuals with these views may experience an altered state of perception through the consumption of substances like "magic mushrooms" or LSD. In these instances, the person may gain temporary access to the Wrathborne Roots. This process is highly dangerous and comes with severe consequences. The effects of consuming large quantities of these substances cause intense physical harm, leading to the eventual failure of their digestive system and kidneys. These individuals often die soon after the experience due to the organ failure caused by their reckless attempt to access the roots.

### The Punishment for Seeking the Roots

As a form of karmic punishment, those who attempt to access the Wrathborne Roots with negative intent or through foolish means, such as using LSD or other hallucinogenic substances, face a fate beyond death. Once these individuals pass away due to the physiological damage caused by their actions, their souls are condemned to be transformed into feral wrathforms. These feral wrathforms are wild and uncontrollable, driven only by the base instincts of their animalistic forms. This punishment is a direct result of their arrogance and ignorance in attempting to access something so sacred, only to be consumed by their own folly.

### Seeing Calm Wrathforms

For individuals who are transphobic or harbor prejudiced views against the queer community, the manifestation of wrathforms is often hidden from their view. Instead of witnessing the true nature of a wrathform, they may only see the animal that the wrathform resembles or represents in its calm state.

However, there are exceptions where, with time and training, a wrathform host can learn to unmask their wrathform to a select group of people who are supportive of their identity. This ability allows the host to reveal the true nature of their wrathform to those they trust, creating a safe space where the wrathform can be acknowledged for its power and significance.

This version now reflects that the organ failure caused by their attempt to access the roots results in death before their soul transforms into a feral wrathform. Let me know if you need further changes!
